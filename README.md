## Callables

* [os/execute](doc/os_execute.md)
* [os/spawn](doc/os_spawn.md)
* [os/proc-wait](doc/os_proc-wait.md)
* [os/proc-close](doc/os_proc-close.md)
* [os/proc-kill](doc/os_proc-kill.md)

## Misc Info

* Use `ev/spawn` to run a background task unless the background task
  makes a blocking call. Neither `os/execute` nor `os/spawn` block. I
  write medium sized, complete programs without using threads at all
  if I can avoid it.

* Don't redirect output to pipes that are never read from. This causes
  things to hang in any language. It's how pipes work on Unix-likes
  and most languages work this way.

* Look to the
  [`sh.janet`](https://github.com/janet-lang/spork/blob/7a4eff4bfb9486a6c6079ee8bb12e6789cce4564/spork/sh.janet)
  examples. They are written that way for a reason [using `ev/gather`
  to avoid race
  conditions](https://github.com/janet-lang/spork/blob/7a4eff4bfb9486a6c6079ee8bb12e6789cce4564/spork/sh.janet#L44-L47). It's
  surprisingly tricky to get this correct - this is why [Python has a
  function
  subprocess.communicate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate)
  to just "do the IO" after spawning a process.

* If you use `os/spawn`, I would always be sure to use `os/proc-wait`.
